# 🧠 LLM vs. SLM: A Comparative Study of Model Trade-Offs

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive comparison between a **Small Language Model (SLM)**, Google's **Gemma 2B Instruct**, and a **Large Language Model (LLM) use case**, demonstrated using **TinyLlama 1.1B**. The goal is to illustrate the critical trade-offs in **performance, efficiency, and ideal use cases**—specifically, prioritizing **low-latency structure** versus **high-scope generality**.

The models are evaluated based on two distinct, real-world tasks:
1.  **SLM (Gemma 2B):** Action Item Extraction (High Precision, Low Latency).
2.  **LLM (TinyLlama 1.1B):** Research Query Suggestion (High Scope, Creative Generality).

## 🚀 Repository Structure

The project is organized into modular folders for easy navigation:

```

## 🛠️ Models and Tasks

| Model Type | Model Used | Primary Task | Key Inference Parameters | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SLM** | **Gemma 2B Instruct** | **Action Item Extraction** (Structured) | `max_new_tokens=200`, `temperature=0` | **Precision, Speed, Cost-Efficiency** |
| **LLM** | **TinyLlama 1.1B Chat** | **Research Query Suggestion** (Open-Ended) | `max_new_tokens=1000`, `temperature=0.7` | **Scope, Creativity, Generalization** |

## 📊 Comparison and Results

The core finding is that model selection is driven by task requirements, not just model size. The comparison focuses on key deployment metrics: **Cost, Latency, Accuracy, and Scalability.**

### Visualization Summary

The charts below illustrate the opposed strengths of the two models on a normalized 1-5 scale (where 5 is optimal for the model type).



* **SLM (Gemma 2B) Strengths (High Score):** Inference Speed (Latency) and Deployment Cost due to its small size and short output requirements.
* **LLM (TinyLlama 1.1B) Strengths (High Score):** General Scalability and Task Complexity/Scope due to its training for broad, creative reasoning.

### Accuracy Analysis (Hypothetical)

Due to the nature of the tasks:
* **SLM Accuracy:** Expected to yield **High Precision** and a strong **F1 Score** (e.g., 0.87+) due to the deterministic settings (`temperature=0`) on its structured task.
* **LLM Accuracy:** Expected to prioritize **High Recall** and **Scope** over strict precision, as creativity (`temperature=0.7`) is favored for generating comprehensive suggestions.

## 📝 Workflow Documentation

Detailed, step-by-step pseudo-code documenting the pipeline for each model is available in the `documentation/` folder. These files outline the specific tokenization, inference settings, and validation logic used.

* [`slm_workflow.txt`](documentation/slm_workflow.txt): Details the low-latency, high-fidelity pipeline.
* [`llm_workflow.txt`](documentation/llm_workflow.txt): Details the high-scope, creative generation pipeline.

## 💻 How to Run the Code

The model code is designed to run in Google Colab, leveraging the `transformers` library and Hugging Face models.

1.  **Open the Notebooks:** Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open either `SLM_Model.ipynb` or `LLM_Model.ipynb`.
2.  **Setup:** Ensure you install the required libraries (`!pip install -q transformers accelerate sentencepiece torch`).
3.  **Hugging Face Login:** Log in using your Hugging Face token to ensure full model access.
4.  **Run Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially to load the model, define the prompt, set the unique inference parameters, and view the final output.
