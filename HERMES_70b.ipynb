            "\n",
            "2. Representing polysemy (multiple meanings of a term) and synonymy (different terms with the same meaning) as vectors in a high-dimensional Hilbert space allows for geometrically modeling the semantic relationships between terms, which is crucial for effective cross-lingual information retrieval.\n",

By representing queries as quantum states that exist in superposition, we can explore and exploit the probabilistic nature of query-term matching.\n",

            "4. Entanglement, a quintessential quantum phenomenon, can be leveraged to create vector spaces where the semantic meaning of terms is intrinsically linked across different languages. This entanglement-based alignment facilitates more accurate cross-lingual information retrieval by ensuring semantic consistency.\n",
